If you want to use it, remember to change the hostname where your server is hosted in src/app/app.config.ts and the name of your topic in src/app/app.component.ts, and install the necessary Angular resources found in src/app/app.config.ts.

Note that by default the app publishes “ON” or “OFF” depending on the state of the toggle switch in the “ledControl” topic.
